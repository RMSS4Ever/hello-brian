Github training

Ok, a bit about myself... 
Took a github course on one of the MOC sites years ago and of course I haven't been using it, so naturally, I pretty much forgot how to do everything. Now, I'm looking into Github again because I've really been working, and learning, about SQL, the PostgreSQL and MySQL flavors, and creating, developing and maintaining a database that will help me to either become a day trader, Data Scientist or a Full Webstack Developer. Not sure which is going to happen first but since I really seem to like the technologies involved, I'm learning a little about alot, which is typically a big no-no but hey, I've pretty much always done it this way with a grand result of suddenly one day waking up and being almost a Guru in it all! You really have to love time, persistance and determination.
