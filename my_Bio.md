Github training

Ok, a bit about myself... 
Took a github course on one of the MOC sites years ago and of course I haven't been using it, so naturally, I pretty much forgot how to do everything. Now, I'm looking into Github again because I've really been working, and learning, about SQL, PostgreSQL and MySQL flavors. I have created, developed and maintained a database for my big project to help me either become a day trader, Data Scientist or a Full Webstack Developer. Not sure which is going to happen first but since I really like the technologies involved, I'm learning a little about alot, which is typically a big no-no but hey, this course of action has always been successful for me, with a grand result of one day I wake up to the realization that people are recognizing my talents and almost being a Guru! You really have to love time, persistance and determination.
